I get that is better overall for it to be buyer sided; however, there are events that can be prevented if they just took everything into account besides ""Oh buyer said this so seller is 100% at fault no questions asked.""  I've seen it too many times where sellers send out properly conditioned cards and then buyer claims ""Oh this isn't NM it's more LP or MP"" and TCG player just goes with what buyer says, even if seller has proof they sent the cards NM.  It definitely just seems easy for buyers to get full refunds for orders that came ""not as described or not delivered"".  Which is hard to prove if it doesn't have tracking, but buyers will says the card isn't as described just to get an easy guaranteed refund.  I just believe TCG player should take what the seller says and has into account if they need to get involved.  A short video showing the cards being packaged and sealed in the envelope and sent out could prevent buyers from scamming sellers and help protect sellers from losing money.

While purchasing small quantities of contemporary cards from trusted sellers still generally works fine, the expansion of the platform since the 2020 collectibles boom has left many sellers that consistently send cards well below grade, counterfeits, or refuse to ship at all, active on the platform seemingly with no recourse for the buyer other than to wait 3-4 weeks to get their money back and start the search all over again. This is especially true for older cards, especially those from 2003 or earlier. Shops regularly list old cards as LP or NM, send out clearly weathered, dirty, and frayed cards, and then hope that the buyer will request a price adjustment rather than a refund.

In general interactions with TCGPlayer staff are fine and more or less what I expect from such a platform. Interactions with some sellers and dealing with disputes on card conditions or other errors though is another matter entirely. 

Recently I've had an uptick in card condition issues on cards I've been receiving from orders and I do believe that is attributable to the softening definition of ""NM Foil"". That change was overall a step backwards and I basically never order NM foils of older cards from TCGPlayer anymore unless they're at a steep discount compared to other places (e.g. ebay, other large vendors) because what can pass for NM Foil here would be LP or MP at most other stores. Sometimes I can order an older ""NM Foil"" and everything is okay as perhaps the particular seller adheres to the old definition of ""NM Foil"" that basically couldn't have flaws, but such sellers are extremely few in number now. 

I can only trust NM Foil to mean NM Foil on recent sets where the cards in question aren't old enough to accumulate significant clouding and chipping and scratches that now seems to pass as ""NM Foil"" on this platform. If you're going to cheapen NM Foil so much, at least introduce a ""MINT Foil"" category and define it as you USED to define NM Foil.",Product,2,85,64.1,No,No,yes

Generally though, there are vastly different design patterns and styling for different sections of the site which can be jarring and disorienting.

Buying from TCGdirect is a pain. The customer service is apparently automated or AI. It's horrible and has lead me to decide to buy directly from small sellers like myself from here on out.

On top of that, the cart optimizer has removed printings I chose even when I select the option not to do so.

Because of several wrong printings and delayed shipping I decided to cancel my purchase. I was told it had already been shipped. That wasn't the case. The order had been lost. Only because I was being obnoxious did TCGdirect decide to look into it and repack and reship my item.

I know this is what happened because I was informed 5 days after it supposedly ""shipped"" that suddenly there was an inventory issue and a card couldn't be found and I would receive a partial refund.

If it actually had been shipped, and was in the possession of the post office (like I was told by ""customer service"") then why was I only informed of the missing card nearly a week later.

Sure enough, right after the missing card email - the package arrives in the USPS tracking system.

On a side note, it was pretty disappointing when bonus bucks were taken away and put behind a paywall. It was sad to see TCGPlayer moving the way of a subscription service like many other things are these days. It is all pretty tiresome.

But most recently if I try to include *any* cards without a TCGPlayer ID in SYP, that shipment gets rejected. Since the pull list is the only official way to get TCGPlayer IDs and it only includes IDs for approved cards, it’s unclear how an SYP seller might submit any unapproved cards if you require the ID for all of them. When I asked, I didn’t get a satisfactory email reply after two attempts. And those replies usually take at least one day turnaround.

5,2,6,4,"I am thoroughly please with the way the website merges shopping cart items when I log back in after getting logged out sometimes.  Although, ""Don't ask on this device"" does NOT work.

There are several pieces of information, motives, and choices that have been made without explanation:
1. Why does TCGplayer put shipping choices on the seller?  The buyer should have to choose whether they want tracking (see ""FOB origin, freight collect"").  Selling a card between $20 and $24 is worthless because the seller automatically loses $4+ to shipping.
2. Why does TCGplayer keep updating the way their cart optimizer works so that it saves the buyer less and less money every time it's changed.  I can almost ALWAYS rearrange my cart manually and save money.
3. Why does TCGplayer not correctly support available quantity?  If a buyer is interested in both regular and foil of a card and a seller has 2 of each, selecting ""4 Or More"" will eliminate that seller.  This problem also applies across conditions (e.g., buyer wants NM or LP and seller has 3 NM and 1 LP, but that seller is excluded).
4. Why does TCGplayer not help sellers compare the prices of their listings with photos to the market/lowest price?
5. Why does TCGplayer make it difficult to shop across card printings?  A search for ""Gaea's Will"" produces 3 results even after clicking ""All versions"".  Careful searching must be performed to find all 6 versions, not 3.
6. Why does TCGplayer make browsing a seller's storefront not facilitate actually ""filling out"" a shopping cart?  It sure would be nice while ""browsing"" a sellers store for the website to highlight cards in the buyers ""Saved for later"" cards.",HomePage,7,20,12.31,Yes,No,yes

I was adding items to my cart and consistently cards that I had added were being removed from my cart as ""unavailable.""

The 2nd statement I somewhat agree with in that you offer a large marketplace as well as community articles to inform customers about on going events and products. However, I strongly believe you should implement a decisive method of shipping for your sellers as to avoid continually damaged and or missing product, as well as false information about whether or not the products in question were in fact ever shipped. Basically a better screening process for your sellers with firm rules of operation as to not reflect poorly on the marketplace itself but the actual sellers who would then be removed.
The 3rd statement I am unsure of either way so left a neutral feedback.
The 4th statement I would say that yes you typically do deliver on promises of resolution, however it should be taken into account price increases/decreases that make the seller hold or resell sold items at higher prices and defraud customers who had ordered items at a lower value.

I am of the belief that this is how they rid of unwanted cards expecting that youths will not take exception to it.  There are good sellers also but it is getting harder to find them on TCG.  TCG should investigate complaints such as this because the way it is presently done only allows you to receive a refund.  There is no investigation done on the seller who is ruining TCG's name.

Specifically, charging the fee percentage that includes the shipping cost is a little predatory. Also the criteria or threshold for being able to sell with TCGDirect is nebulous. 

I am really happy with the recent announcement of being able to scan cards into inventory from the mobile app, because before that we had to do some hacky solutions. If y’all can focus on streamlining every possible way for people to be able to add inventory, you and sellers will make money a lot faster. A specific example I have is putting a minus and plus button next to all quantity fields to be able to increase or decrease with one tap. This allows me to have my phone in one hand and cards in another and quickly add inventory. This also hopes and assumes that you update the pricing or inventory pages for mobile devices eventually. Pinching to zoom is bad UX.

This new Apple mixed reality goggle device coming out would be a great win especially. Imagine wearing them, picking up a card, looking at it, then being able to instantly digitize and inventory it.

1,2,1,2,"A small group helping me has bought over $25000 from TCG over last 4 years for a huge charity and promotion project related to a scifi series that I'm writing, spending a tremendous amount of my overtime on cards I plan to mostly giveaway or sell for charity.
1.  Your recent change to the cart structure made me miserable!!!  I place orders with 20 to 50 sellers at a time because I normally need 200 copies of most cards.  
  a.  sellers are no longer alphabetical causing so many problems in setting up orders.
  b.  I often take 1-4 weeks to put together a order.  Before offline sellers were still available.  $$$ Only improvement I've seen was option to remove seller from cart.  So why auto delete an offline seller when we may wait for them to come back online????  We can already take them out if we want!!!   I have been putting together a order for over $2000 with over 80 sellers for over a month.  in the last week I've had over 10 sellers drop with sometimes 100's of cards that I have to redo all over because of you new way of running carts.  Will cost me 40-50 hours at least.
2.  You allow sellers to cancel orders without any reason or negative repercussions.  Often the cancel to resell the same card because price went up.  I have wasted 100s of hours on cancelled orders.  A cancelled order or missing card should require a $150% refund by seller for unprofessional management of their inventory.  Many Sellers are Very dishonest on TCG.
3.  Price fixing is going on by some TCG sellers.  When you see a dozen recent sales for a card between .15 - .50, but one sale is for 4 copies at 1.99, thats a huge red flag.  I see the same sellers names many times selling cards for many times the market average.  if they or a friend buys their inflated cards and then cancel the order, I believe you system still treats it as a sale causing the market value to jump.  Many sellers go by this when listing costing me a great deal of money.   Strictly Business, Sigma Patton and several others do this commonly.
4. Cancellation of a order is a waste of buyers time (which is lost money too).  Most dont even contact the buyer to try to work out the issues.  When I gave them the negative rating this deserved, Tcg removed them for many sellers I rated.  TCG took away my right to give honest rating for failure to provide bought product.
5.  TCG direct use to tell me how many cards of a type there were.  It is much harder to buy using TCG direct for my orders since your changes.  I also see a much poorer inventory available than in the past.
6.  for a long time, I have been unable to print off my cart listings when I am trying to finalize my large orders.

I use TCG currently as a necessary evil from all the nonsense that I've endured, for my promotion and charity project.  I have been forced to find other sources for the cards I need.  Out of frustration with the unfair and sometimes dishonest dealing on TCG, I have bought 20-25% of my cards from other sources.

I would like to be contacted by someone in TCG management about the issues that I have brought up in this survey.    Jack Fetter   804-210-6732   (1pm - 10pm best time)",HomePage,1,1,649.7,Yes,No,no

Suggestion: Sellers should be able to set a floor of product price they are willing to ship. If the optimizer sorts cheap products to a high volume seller, the likelihood that they ship that product is lower than normal, even with their ability to set shipping.

4,1,6,5,"I had a recent experience as a buyer that involved a seller not shipping what I ordered. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to contact TCGplayer to resolve the problem. The chat bot creates an endless loop that prevents you from contacting TCGplayer. There is no clearly posted way to contact customer support (which I imagine is intentional). 

I eventually found a phone number to an appropriate voicemail and left a message. I quickly received a response from TCGplayer (very good response time) and a refund, plus $5 because a card went up significantly in value. I asked for $8. Petty, I realize, but why not refund the actual difference in value? A human reviewed my request and decided to offset the loss... partially? Why? After receiving the response, I noticed I had no way to leave feedback on the transaction. Which is what other buyers rely on when choosing sellers. I was able to look up the seller manually to see what others were writing. The recent reviews were not positive, as others were clearly receiving the same treatment. 

Overall, I have been satisfied with your service over the last few months. This has only happened with one seller. However, the difficulty resolving the problem, the chat bot, the hard to find customer service voicemail, blocking feedback, etc., suggests to me that your company is more interested in protecting unethical sellers than buyers, and not particularly interested in dealing with disputes at all.

There is a policy I disagree with, but mostly because the affect is has on shopping is a net negative. I at one time ordered an SLD Captain Sisay. I thought it hadn't arrived. Weeks went by and eventually I received a refund. A long time after that, I found the letter in a stack of mail that was put in a box instead of being left on the table by another housemate. I contacted the seller, and then paid for the card (and kicked in extra to cover the confusion) but am still banned from purchasing cards from them because of the requested refund. This would be OK if it were not somewhat awkward ordering cards as occasionally cards from that seller are added to my cart and then I have to manually shop for cards from another vendor.

I would never buy a card again from this site unfortunately because 98% of the listings don't have photos to even view card condition and blindly trusting a seller who says its near mint and praying that it's actually closer to mint is not a viable plan for someone like me. 
If a mint category was created it would open you up to an entire new market of buyers, and it would allow sellers to actually sell cards at a higher price.
Making sellers provide detailed front/back photos of each card would be a good start.
Secondly actually allowing customers to message sellers in some form to ask about card condition or to ask for photos would be another step forward.
Or maybe that can be solved in 1 big step: Add a ""Mint"" category, and if a seller is listing a card in that category, then they will need to provide front, back & corner images to show proof that it belongs in the mint category/warrants charging more than market price.

The record only goes back so far, and I already buy enough to qualify for free shipping, or have already paid shipping with the vendor, then have to pay the post office for my items. I have reiterated this numerous times and nobody seems to want to help me resolve the problem other than the useless chatbot. You guys have yet to give me any kind of credit, or fee from the seller who ships without proper postage. I order a high volume of items from this website as I run a business and am stuck HAVING TO deal with it and eat the cost innumerable times. I pay at least forty cents for every other package sent to me after I have already paid shipping, so I pay it twice every other product I order. That makes it so that I HAVE to order in high volume. Then your site craps out and doesn't save half of the stuff I put in my cart, or signs me out then when I sign in it is all gone again. What a headache just to have constant shipping issues and no help when I try to fix it. I really look EVERYWHERE ELSE FIRST before coming to use this site anymore.

Come Monday I received an email and a TCG staff member reached out to me and I was told everything would be fixed. A part of the second question doesn't make any sense, motives? I will leave that one alone, its speculative. The third and fourth questions seem straight forward enough. Everyone wants to be treated with a level of respect, even if its fake. Honestly, if a company is doing what they set out to do and is reinforcing those standards then their shouldn't be a reason to campaign, generally speaking, outside of an issue or problem of course.

7,5,5,7,"TCGplayer is a awesome place to buy product but I feel sellers need to be educated on how to mail cards so they do not incur extra postage. So many envelopes with $5 worth of cards arrive with $3.40 due because it is too thick. Now everyone loses. 
Also, I could not get an answer as to why your shopping cart does not allow people to purchase from only one seller and not all the sellers in cart? Sometimes I see a great deal but I have to ""save for later"" everything in my cart before I can buy that great deal. Sooo Frustrating. Thanks",Product,1,116,42.11,No,No,yes
